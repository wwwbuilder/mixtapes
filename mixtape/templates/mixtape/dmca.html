     <h3 id="copyright">Copyright Infringement Notifications</h3>
     <p> 
    If you are a copyright owner, authorized to act on behalf of one, or authorized to act under any exclusive right under copyright, please report alleged copyright infringements taking place on or through our Services by completing a DMCA Notice of Alleged Infringement and sending it to our Designated Copyright Agent. Upon receipt of notice as described below, 24/7 Mixtapes will take whatever action, in its sole discretion, it deems appropriate, including removal of the challenged content from the Site.
     
    An effective notice must contain the following:
     
    An electronic or physical signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
     
    A description of the copyrighted work claimed to be infringed;
     
    A description of where the allegedly infringing material is located;
     
    Information reasonably sufficient to permit 24/7 Mixtapes to contact you, including a physical address, telephone number, and e-mail address at which you may be contacted;
     
    A statement by you indicating you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner or the law (like a fair use exception), such as: "I hereby state that I have a good faith belief that the disputed use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law."
     
    A statement by you declaring that the information contained in the notification is accurate and that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the exclusive right that is allegedly infringed, such as: "I hereby state that the information in this Notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that I am the owner of the copyrighted work that is allegedly infringed."

     <h3 id="counter">Copyright Infringement Counter-Notification</h3>
     <p>
    If your User Content has been affected because of a notification under the DMCA and you believe your content to be non-infringing, you may make a counter-notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. You will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that your User Content is not infringing.
     
    Your counter-notification must be sent to 24/7 Mixtapes' Designated Agent and must contain the following information:
     
    Your name, address, telephone number, email address, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court in which your address is located, or if you reside outside the United States, your consent to the jurisdiction of a federal court in any district where 24/7 Mixtapes is located, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under the DMCA or an agent of that person;
     
    An identification of the URL(s) or other specific indicators identifying the material that 24/7 Mixtapes has removed or to which 24/7 Mixtapes has disabled access;
     
    A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good-faith belief that the User Content at issue was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification; and
     
    Your physical or electronic signature.
     </p>
     
     <h3 id="after">After Counter-Notice</h3>
     <p>
    Upon receipt of a valid counter-notice, we will promptly forward a copy to the person who filed the original notice. If we do not receive notice within 10 business days that the original reporter is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the material at issue, we may replace or cease disabling access to the material that was removed.
     
    We cannot offer any legal advice. Should you have questions, please consult an attorney.
